# Automagik Telemetry Documentation Reorganization Plan

## Executive Summary

The automagik-telemetry repository has 22 markdown files scattered across multiple directories with significant redundancy and unclear navigation. This plan reorganizes them into a clear, hierarchical structure organized around user journey: Beginners → Developers → Contributors.

**Key Issues:**
- Documentation fragmented across root, /docs, /python, /typescript, and /infra
- 6 test documentation files with duplicate content
- Configuration details scattered across 4+ files
- ClickHouse information split across 3 different documents
- No navigation index - users don't know where to start

**Solution:** Create organized subdirectories with clear purpose, consolidate redundant content, and add navigation hub.

## Key Features of New Structure

### 1. Clear Navigation Hub (docs/INDEX.md)
Users immediately see:
- Quick entry points for different roles (beginner, developer, contributor)
- Organized by user journey
- Topic-based lookup
- Links to all major documentation

### 2. Organized By User Type
- **USER_GUIDES/** - For people using the SDK
  - Getting started, configuration, backend selection, privacy
- **DEVELOPER_GUIDES/** - For contributors & maintainers
  - Architecture, testing, implementation patterns
- **REFERENCES/** - For quick lookup
  - API, environment variables, troubleshooting

### 3. Single Source of Truth
- Configuration options in ONE file (CONFIGURATION.md)
- ClickHouse information consolidated (BACKENDS.md)
- Test instructions consolidated (TESTING.md)
- Environment variables documented in one place (ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)

### 4. Clear Audience
Each document starts with "Who this is for":
- GETTING_STARTED.md - New users with 5 minutes
- IMPLEMENTATION.md - Project maintainers adding telemetry
- ARCHITECTURE.md - Contributors understanding system design
- SDK_DIFFERENCES.md - Developers using both Python & TypeScript

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical (Week 1)
1. **Create docs/INDEX.md** - Navigation hub
2. **Create docs/GETTING_STARTED.md** - Consolidated entry point
3. **Create docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDES/TESTING.md** - Consolidate test docs
4. **Create docs/USER_GUIDES/BACKENDS.md** - Consolidate ClickHouse docs

### Phase 2: High Priority (Week 2)
5. **Create docs/USER_GUIDES/CONFIGURATION.md** - Single source of truth
6. **Create docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDES/ARCHITECTURE.md** - From TELEMETRY_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE
7. **Create docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDES/SDK_DIFFERENCES.md** - From CONVENTIONS
8. **Update README.md** - Point to new structure

### Phase 3: Medium Priority (Week 3)
9. **Create docs/REFERENCES/** - API, env vars, troubleshooting
10. **Simplify SDK READMEs** - python/ and typescript/
11. **Update infra/README.md** - Links to docs/

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Week 4)
12. **Archive/delete** - Old files after migration complete
13. **Cross-reference** - Add "see also" between related docs
14. **Review** - Get community feedback on structure
