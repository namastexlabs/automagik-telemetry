## How to Run

### Python

```bash

cd python
pip install -e ".[dev,integration]"

# Run all integration tests
pytest -v -m integration

# Run specific test file
pytest -v tests/test_integration_fastapi.py

# Run with verbose output to see details
pytest -v -s tests/test_integration_otlp.py

# Skip integration tests (unit tests only)
pytest -v -m "not integration"
```

### TypeScript

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd typescript
pnpm install

# Run all tests (includes integration)
pnpm test

# Run only integration tests
pnpm test -- integration.test.ts

# Run with verbose output
pnpm test -- --verbose integration.test.ts

# Run specific test suite
pnpm test -- --testNamePattern="Real OTLP Collector"

# Enable in CI
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true pnpm test
```

## Key Features

### Realistic Scenarios

- **HTTP Server Integration**: Actual FastAPI/Express apps with telemetry
- **Production Load**: Tests handle 1,000+ events/sec
- **Real Network**: Tests communicate with actual OTLP collector
- **Long-Running**: Memory tests run for 30+ seconds

### Comprehensive Coverage

- **All Signal Types**: Traces, metrics (gauge/counter/histogram), logs
- **All Severity Levels**: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
- **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, retries, timeouts
- **Concurrency**: Multiple threads/async operations

### Quality Assurance

- **Memory Leak Detection**: Verifies no memory leaks over thousands of events
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Measures latency, throughput, overhead
- **Resource Cleanup**: Verifies threads and resources are properly cleaned up
- **Queue Management**: Ensures queues don't grow unbounded

### CI/CD Ready

- **Marker-based**: Easy to include/exclude from CI pipelines
- **Environment Variables**: Configurable endpoints and behavior
- **Timeouts**: Proper timeouts for long-running tests
- **Skip in CI**: TypeScript tests skip by default in CI (configurable)

## Test Statistics

### Python
- **Total Lines**: 1,566 lines of integration tests
- **Test Files**: 4 files
- **Test Functions**: ~45 test functions
- **Coverage**: All major SDK features

### TypeScript

- **Test Cases**: ~25 test cases
- **Coverage**: All major SDK features

## Environment Variables

Both SDKs support:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `AUTOMAGIK_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | Enable telemetry | `false` |
| `AUTOMAGIK_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` | Collector endpoint | `https://telemetry.namastex.ai` |
| `AUTOMAGIK_TELEMETRY_VERBOSE` | Verbose output | `false` |
| `AUTOMAGIK_TELEMETRY_TIMEOUT` | Request timeout | `5` seconds |

TypeScript also supports:
| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS` | Run in CI | `false` |

## Performance Expectations

### Python
- **Event generation**: 10,000+ events/sec
- **Flush latency**: < 500ms for 100 events
- **Memory overhead**: < 5 MB for 10,000 events
- **Concurrent requests**: 100 requests in < 2s

### TypeScript
- **Event generation**: 8,000+ events/sec
- **Flush latency**: < 500ms for 100 events
- **Memory overhead**: < 10 MB for 5,000 events
- **Concurrent requests**: 100 requests in < 2s

## Next Steps

1. **Run the tests locally** to verify they work in your environment
2. **Integrate into CI/CD** pipeline for automated testing
3. **Monitor test performance** over time to detect regressions
4. **Extend tests** as new features are added to the SDKs

Full documentation available in:
- `/docs/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` - Complete guide
- `/python/tests/INTEGRATION_TESTS_README.md` - Python quick reference
- `/typescript/tests/INTEGRATION_TESTS_README.md` - TypeScript quick reference

## Notes

- Integration tests require network access for OTLP collector tests
- Memory tests require `psutil` package
- FastAPI tests require `fastapi` and `httpx` packages
- All dependencies can be installed via `pip install -e ".[integration]"`
- Tests are marked and can be easily skipped in CI if needed
- TypeScript tests are skipped in CI by default (set `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true` to enable)
