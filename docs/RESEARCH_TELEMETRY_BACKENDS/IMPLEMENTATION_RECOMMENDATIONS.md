## Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Currently Using OTLP, Want to Switch to Direct ClickHouse
```
Steps:
1. Update SDK configuration (change backend to "clickhouse")
2. Point to ClickHouse instance instead of collector
3. No code changes needed - API identical
4. Test in staging first

Rollback: Change config back to OTLP

Risk: Low - configuration only, no code changes
```

### Scenario 2: Want to Support Multiple Backends
```
Future Architecture (Phase 2):
```python
# Users can choose backend via environment variable
backend = os.getenv("TELEMETRY_BACKEND", "clickhouse")

if backend == "clickhouse":
    client = AutomagikTelemetry(
        backend="clickhouse",
        clickhouse_endpoint="..."
    )
elif backend == "otlp":
    client = AutomagikTelemetry(
        backend="otlp",
        endpoint="..."
    )
else:
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown backend: {backend}")

# Rest of code is identical regardless of backend
client.track_event("app.started", {...})
```

Implementation effort: Medium (2-4 weeks)
```

### Scenario 3: Want to Add Signoz as Option
```
Why consider Signoz:
- Users want easier setup
- Better UI out of the box
- Still uses ClickHouse backend (same efficiency)

Implementation:
1. Document Signoz as alternative option
2. Add setup guide comparing ClickHouse vs Signoz
3. No code changes needed
4. Signoz already receives OTLP from SDK

Trade-off: More complexity in docs, no code change

Recommendation: Good optional alternative to document
```

    @abstractmethod
    def send_metric(self, metric: dict) -> None:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def send_log(self, log: dict) -> None:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def flush(self) -> None:
        pass

class ClickHouseBackend(TelemetryBackend):
    # Existing implementation
    pass

class OTLPBackend(TelemetryBackend):
    # Generic OTLP receiver support
